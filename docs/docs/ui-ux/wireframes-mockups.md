# UI/UX Documentation: Wireframes and Mockups

Wireframes and mockups are crucial visual representations in the UI/UX design process. They help in visualizing the layout, structure, and visual design of the platform before development begins.

## Wireframes

Wireframes are low-fidelity, black-and-white representations of a page's layout. They focus on:

-   **Content Placement:** Where different elements (text, images, buttons) will be located.
-   **Structure:** The hierarchy and organization of information.
-   **Functionality:** Basic interaction elements and their purpose.

Wireframes are used early in the design process to quickly iterate on layouts and ensure that the fundamental structure meets user needs and functional requirements. They intentionally lack visual details to keep the focus on functionality and user flow.

**Examples of Wireframes (Conceptual):

-   **Student Dashboard:** A simple layout showing sections for "My Courses," "Upcoming Quizzes," "Progress Report," and "AI Assistant Chat."
-   **Teacher Class Management:** A wireframe outlining areas for "Class List," "Add Student," "Assign Project," and "View Analytics."
-   **Parent Portal:** A basic structure for "Child's Progress," "Notifications," and "Message Teacher."

## Mockups

Mockups are high-fidelity, static visual designs that incorporate more detailed UI elements, colors, typography, and imagery. They provide a realistic preview of the final product's appearance.

Mockups are used to:

-   **Visualize Aesthetics:** Show the look and feel of the user interface.
-   **Refine Visual Design:** Experiment with color palettes, fonts, and iconography.
-   **Present to Stakeholders:** Provide a clear representation of the intended design to gather feedback.

**Examples of Mockups (Conceptual):

-   **Student Quiz Interface:** A visually complete design of a quiz screen, including question text, answer options, progress bar, and a timer, all styled according to the platform's brand guidelines.
-   **Teacher Analytics Dashboard:** A colorful and data-rich mockup displaying charts and graphs for student performance, with interactive elements for filtering data.
-   **Parent Performance Report:** A polished design of a report card-like interface, showing grades, AI-generated insights, and options to communicate with the teacher.

## Tools for Wireframing and Mockup Creation

Commonly used tools for creating wireframes and mockups include:

-   Figma
-   Sketch
-   Adobe XD
-   Miro (for collaborative whiteboarding and basic wireframing)

These tools allow for efficient design, collaboration, and prototyping, ensuring a smooth transition from concept to development.
