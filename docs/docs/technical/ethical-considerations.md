# Technical Documentation: Ethical Considerations

This section addresses the ethical implications and limitations of the AI-Powered Adaptive Learning Platform.

## 5.1 Ethical Concerns

-   **Data Privacy:** Protecting sensitive student data is paramount. The platform must be designed with strong data anonymization, encryption, and strict access controls. User consent for data collection, especially for features like proctoring, must be explicit and clear.
    
-   **Algorithmic Bias:** The AI models must be trained on diverse and representative datasets to avoid perpetuating biases. The system must be regularly audited for fairness and equity to ensure it doesn't disadvantage certain groups of students.
    
-   **Student Well-being:** Features like sentiment analysis must be used responsibly. The goal is to assist students, not to surveil them. It must be a tool for early intervention, not a means of punishment.
    

## 5.2 Limitations

-   **Technical Complexity:** The project requires a highly skilled team of AI/ML engineers, backend developers, and a robust infrastructure to handle the computational demands of real-time AI processing.
    
-   **User Adoption:** Teachers and students may be hesitant to adopt a new platform, especially one with AI features. Comprehensive training and a focus on user-friendly design will be crucial.
    
-   **Offline Mode Constraints:** While offline mode allows for content consumption, real-time features like proctoring, chat, and adaptive question generation will still require a stable internet connection.
