# Technical Documentation: Implementation Plan

## 3.3 Project Management

-   **Methodology:** **Scrum**, an Agile framework, will be used to manage the project. This will involve working in short sprints (e.g., two weeks), with daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives. This iterative approach allows for continuous feedback and quick adaptation to new requirements.

## Phased Rollout Strategy

-   **Phase 1 (MVP - Minimum Viable Product):** Focus on core features: user authentication, basic class management, video integration, and a simple quiz engine.
    
-   **Phase 2 (AI Integration):** Introduce the AI-powered question generation and basic performance tracking.
    
-   **Phase 3 (Advanced Features):** Implement study groups, proctoring, parent portal, and sentiment analysis.
