# Technical Documentation: Backend & AI Details

## Backend & AI Engine

-   **Language:** **Python** is the unequivocal choice for the backend and AI. Its rich ecosystem of libraries is unmatched.
    
-   **Frameworks:** **FastAPI** is a strong recommendation. It is built on modern Python standards, offering exceptional performance and simplicity. It’s perfect for building the microservices that will power your AI features, as it’s fast and easy to document.
    
-   **AI/ML Libraries:**
    
    -   **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow:** These are the industry standards for building deep learning models, which will be the core of your adaptive learning engine and sentiment analysis.
        
    -   **Hugging Face Transformers:** This library is a must-have for natural language processing (NLP) tasks like question generation, content summarization, and AI-powered tutoring.
        
    -   **OpenCV:** For the smart proctoring and sentiment analysis features, this library is essential for computer vision tasks.
        
-   **Database:**
    
    -   **PostgreSQL:** For your primary data storage (user information, course data, performance metrics), PostgreSQL is highly recommended. It is a powerful, reliable, and scalable relational database.
        
    -   **Redis:** Use this for caching and real-time data needs, like temporary storage for live chat messages and proctoring session data, to ensure a snappy user experience.
