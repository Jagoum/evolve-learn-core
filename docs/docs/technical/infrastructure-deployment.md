## Infrastructure and Deployment

-   **Cloud Provider:** **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** is the recommended cloud provider. Its **Vertex AI** platform offers a unified and streamlined environment for building, deploying, and managing machine learning models, which simplifies the AI development lifecycle. Services like **Cloud Storage** for video content and **Cloud Run** for serverless microservices will ensure scalability and cost-effectiveness.
    
-   **Video Integration:** For YouTube video playback, you will use the **YouTube Data API**. For video uploads and hosting, a service like **Vimeo API** or a custom solution built on **AWS S3** and a **CDN** (Content Delivery Network) is recommended to ensure smooth streaming.
